# Best Anti-Colic Baby Bottles for Newborns — Top 5 Picks for 2025

Welcome, Mama! 💜  
You’ve just arrived home with your newborn — only to face an unexpected challenge: dealing with your baby’s gas and colic (which I promise will gradually ease over time until it disappears completely).

Even if you’ve read all the baby books in the world, the first month with a newborn always feels different from what you imagined. But you’re stronger than you think — and with the support of your partner, family, or friends, getting through these early days becomes so much easier.  
And thanks to amazing advancements in baby products, managing gas and fussiness is now way more achievable than before.

## Why Anti-Colic Bottles Matter 💨

Newborns often swallow air while feeding, which leads to gas and discomfort.  
Anti-colic bottles use vents or internal valves to reduce how much air your baby takes in — meaning calmer feeds and better sleep for both of you.
