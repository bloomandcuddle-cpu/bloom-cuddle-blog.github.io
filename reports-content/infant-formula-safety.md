# Safety Notice: Important Information for Parents About Infant Formula

Recently, ByHeart voluntarily recalled its Whole Nutrition Infant Formula due to a potential link to rare cases of infant botulism. This recall is a precautionary measure, and ByHeart is working closely with health authorities to ensure the safety of their products.

While the company has taken responsible steps to protect families, parents are advised to temporarily stop using any affected formula and consult their pediatrician for safe alternatives.

## What is Infant Botulism?

Infant botulism is a rare but serious neurological illness that affects babies under one year old. It occurs when spores of Clostridium botulinum are ingested and produce a neurotoxin in the infant’s intestines. This can lead to symptoms such as:

- Constipation (often the first sign)
- Weak suck or difficulty feeding
- Floppy head or generalized muscle weakness
- Drooping eyelids or weak cry
- Excessive fatigue

## Key Safety Tips for Parents:

- Check your formula at home and follow the recall instructions if it’s affected.
- Monitor your baby for any unusual symptoms, and seek medical care promptly if needed.
- Infant botulism is very rare, and awareness plus early action can help keep babies safe.
